# Usage of the words NATO and NASA on twitter

## Abstract:
This project aims to investigate the difference in popularity of the words "NATO" and "NASA" on Twitter after two significant events, namely the ongoing war in Ukraine and NASA's Artemis program announcement. The research question is to find out if there is a difference in the number of tweets featuring these words and to explore possible reasons for any observed differences. The significance of this study lies in helping readers understand if certain events affect the usage of these words on Twitter. The independent variables are the two events, while the dependent variables are the number of tweets mentioning NATO and NASA. The hypothesis is that NATO will have a higher popularity ratio in tweets compared to NASA. The method used is a corpus of tweets.

## Background:
Previous research has explored the use of Twitter to study public opinion and sentiment on various topics. One study analyzed tweets about NATO and found that the sentiment towards the organization was generally positive, with a few negative tweets regarding its involvement in certain conflicts (De Melo et al., 2012). Another study investigated the use of social media by NASA to promote its programs and found that Twitter was an effective tool for disseminating information and engaging with the public (Zhang et al., 2016).

## Research Question and Hypothesis:
Research Question: What is the difference in popularity in usage of the words "NATO" and "NASA" after two certain events (war in Ukraine and Artemisprogramm announcement)?
Hypothesis: The popularity ratio of NATO is higher. NASA will also be popular, but NATO had a significant increase in popularity in tweets.

## Method:
The method used in this project is a corpus of tweets. A dataset of tweets containing the words "NATO" and "NASA" will be collected. The dataset will be filtered to include tweets that were posted after the two events (war in Ukraine and Artemisprogramm announcement) and will be analyzed for the number of tweets featuring each word. A statistical analysis will be conducted to compare the number of tweets mentioning NATO and NASA and to explore possible reasons for any observed differences.
